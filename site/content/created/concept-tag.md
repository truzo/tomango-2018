For years, retailers have been fighting an ongoing battle with shoplifters who are determined to nick their stock. The Concept Tag is a new type of retail security tag that’s set to revolutionise the industry.

Our client Agon Systems asked us to design printed literature and a website to raise the profile of this new product and generate new enquiries from national retailers.

We created a single page site that tells the story of the product and contains a costs-versus-ROI calculator, so customers can see for themselves how much money the Concept Tag will save them.
