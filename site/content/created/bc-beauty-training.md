BC Beauty Training is an award-winning Brighton-based provider of accredited courses that cover all aspects of beauty, including hair, makeup, tanning, nails and massage.
 
The company’s Managing Director, Maria Lloyd, first got in touch with Tomango in early 2016. She wanted some assistance with a Google AdWords campaign that they had been running for a while, but wasn’t returning many enquiries for
beauty courses.
 
After inviting Maria to our studio, finding out more about her business, and conducting a short audit of the website, we saw a big opportunity to optimise it for search.

From our findings we then presented to Maria a plan of action that would see Tomango take over the AdWords management, but at the same time seek to increase organic visibility via local SEO
 
With BC Beauty Training operating on a strict marketing budget, over time we were able to work together to increase traffic to the website from organic search results and remove the need to spend extra money on AdWords entirely.
 
After making changes to their website, as well as working with them to improve their Google Business listing by focusing on generating valuable reviews from students, BC Beauty Training saw a dramatic increase in student sign-ups.
 
For the latter half of 2017, their website was receiving on average **seven** enquiries per month from organic search.
 
Up to October 2018, this figure has increased to an average of **eighteen enquiries per month** - an increase of **157 per cent**.
 
With a large majority of new students attending multiple beauty training courses, the potential lifetime value of each one has meant that BC Beauty Training has not only managed to reduce their overall marketing spend, but enjoy a
solid return on their marketing investment.
