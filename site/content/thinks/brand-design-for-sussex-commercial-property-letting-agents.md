[Oldfield Smith](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk/) is a new [commercial letting agent](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk/what-we-do/agency/) based in Uckfield, established by [Richard Oldfield](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk/who-we-are/richard-oldfield/) and [Bernard Smith](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk/who-we-are/bernard-smith/).  Richard and Bernard approached *Tomango* in the spring of 2013 to ask us to develop their brand identity and website.

## Brand design brief

Their brand identity needed to express Oldfield Smith's quality of service,  combining the highest professional standards with a warm, open and honest service.  The image they want to portray is approachable, honest, professional, results-driven and enthusiastic.

Once we had established the brand design brief with the client, our design team was able to set to work on creating concepts.

## 1. Graphic device

Our design team set about researching all the elements of the design, including what Oldfield Smith's competition looked like.

We first looked at the graphic device, and explored an idea that the client was keen to look at; the combining of the "O" and "S" of the business name.

Several variations on this theme were created, which you can see below.

## 2. Typeface

The next step was to look at the typeface.

As always, we choose a typeface for the client that fitted their brief.

We were looking for something that was professional but also friendly and approachable.  It couldn't be too harsh or stuffy.

## 3. Colours

The selection of colour was next and, although the client had strong feelings about the colours that they wanted to use, we still considered whether an alternative colour was worth considering.

Sometimes it is important to challenge the client's views, even if they are strong and appear well-founded.  Part of our job is to look at all the alternatives, to ensure the final brand identity is as good as it can be, and that all bases have been covered.

The result was that the preferred colour *was* considered to fit the brief the best, however the exact shade was important, particularly in how it looked in print.  In order to demonstrate how the colour would look exactly, we showed the client the colour in a pantone book.

How the colour appears on a website is, of course, quite different; variations in monitor types, quality and settings mean that slight variations will be seen between users.

## 4. In Situ

Finally, we took a great deal of time to examine how the brand would work in different situations.

Business stationery, including letterhead, business card and comp slip, was mocked up and several design ideas were presented to the client.

For Oldfield Smith, the design of their agent boards was vital, and we looked at several different layouts and colour schemes before presenting our preferred concept to the client for approval.

Finally, once the [brand identity](/creates/brand/) was pretty much agreed, we moved on to the website design where the brand was used again in conjunction with the complementary colours that had been explored earlier in the process.

## The result

The final brand identity fits Richard &amp; Bernard's brief but also sets them apart from their competition and works in a wide range of scenarios; it looks great on their business stationery, sale boards and [website](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk/) and works equally well whether large or small, colour or monochrome.

> “Richard and I are delighted with the brand identity and website and we think this is some of your best work.  It really has captured the brief very well and we are tremendously excited about the website going live next week.”
