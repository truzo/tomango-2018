Writing copy for your website is hard. Writing *good* copy is even harder.

A common misconception about writing good copy is that it must be lavish, flowing and full of impressive words; and many writers find this prospect intimidating.

> The best copy is easy to read

But it turns out that if you want your copy to be more widely read - by more people and in more detail - you need to simplify it.

You need to write like you're writing for a nine year old.

In a wonderful bit of analysis by [Shane Snow at Contently](http://shanesnow.contently.com/), he establishes that the most popular authors consistently write for a lower *reading age level*.

There are lots of formulas for measuring the "reading level" of written work, and Shane uses the most common of these, which is called the [Flesch-Kincaid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) test.

He ran a whole load of well known books through the test, and found some very [interesting results](http://contently.com/strategist/2015/01/28/this-surprising-reading-level-analysis-will-change-the-way-you-write/).

Shane says in his blog post that "This...Analysis Will Change The Way You Write" - and it certainly has for me.

I'd like to share with you *my* understanding of the analysis and how I've applied it to my copywriting.

## An explanation of the analysis

The Flesch-Kincaid test is a formula that calculates very quickly the "reading level" of any piece of written work, whether it's a short chapter in a book or a 1000-word report.

It works this out from the number of syllables in the words, the length of sentences and lots of other stuff including how complicated the vocabulary is and gives it a score in line with the school reading age that would be able to understand it.

For instance, a score of 7.9 means you'd need an 8th-grade (13-14 years old) reading level to be able to understand it. Or 8 years of school reading education (after kindergarten/reception class).

A score of 4 means you'd need a 4th grade (9-10 years old) reading level.

## What you should be aiming for

Shane was dismayed to find his own writing scored 7.9 - so he went off and compared various famous authors to see what scores they got.

What he found - somewhat to his surprise, he admits - was all the most popular authors scored *low* on this test, suggesting that if you want your writing to be popular and more widely shared, make it *easier to read*.

## Why this is important to your customers

But you're not aiming at children right?

Well...

In 2003, a survey showed 15% of UK adults (that's 5.1 million people) had the reading level of an 11 year old. What's more, we tend to "read down" a level when we're reading online - because we scan text quickly looking for the information we want, and tend to have shorter concentration spans.

*Your* audience will appreciate you writing like they're 9 years old.

## Why you should care that your writing is readable


### People will stick around and read what you've written

If you want to persuade a customer to buy your products instead of those of your competitors, you need to be able to hold their attention and get your message across quickly.

### People are more likely to share your content

Your content gets a wider audience when it's share across social media.

Writing simply will increase the chances of this happening. Readers want information they can digest quickly.

### You can turn more visitors to subscribers or customers

How often have you stopped reading a web page part way through because it was just *such hard work?*

I bet you didn't hang around to do anything else either, like buy something or sign up to an email list. Who's going to sign up to receive *even more* of this stuff?

This is why you should invest a little bit of time in making your copy as readable as possible.

## How to become a better writer

So you understand *why* you should do it - but what about *how* you do it?

Here's three things you can do to make your writing better:

### 1. Use shorter sentences

The first thing you can do to make your writing easier to read is to make your sentences shorter. Much shorter.

Let's look at an example of how I did this on the new Tomango site.

Here's the original copy from the [Brand](/creates/brand/) page;

![](images/blog/Brand-copy-version-1.jpg "Original copy")

The first sentence is fine. The second sentence sucks. The third sentence had potential but felt a bit clumsy.

The second paragraph also has issues; the first sentence is ok but needed some refinement. The second sentence just doesn't know when to quit.

I re-worked this whole passage and came up with the following, which I was much happier with:

![](images/blog/Brand-copy-version-2.jpg "Edited copy. Much better...")

Much shorter sentences. Much less work.

### 2. Change clever words for simpler ones

The next thing I did was to see where I could replace a word with something simpler that meant the same thing, and didn't negatively impact on the overall tone.

For example, this original paragraph was taken from the [Web design](/creates/web/) page:

![](images/blog/Web-design-copy-version-1.jpg "Original copy")

I changed this to:

![](images/blog/Web-design-copy-version-2.jpg "Edited copy - much simpler...")

And this passage, taken from the [Ecommerce](/creates/web/) page:

![](images/blog/Ecommerce-copy-version-1.jpg "Original copy")

Was replaced with:

![](images/blog/Ecommerce-copy-version-2.jpg "Edited copy")

### 3. Make your copy more conversational

How often have you seen a piece of copy that looks something like this:

__You will be suitably impressed with all the members of our customer services team. They are all trained to an exceptional standard so you will always feel well looked after.__

Read the passage out loud (or quietly to yourself if you're in an open plan office). Do you sound like a robot?

It's a common trap to fall into, and comes from the speed you type compared to the speed you think and talk.

Here's my top tips for making your copy more conversational:

#### 1. Apostrophise (made up word?)

Go through your work and look for all instances where you can use an apostrophe to make the tone more informal. Change "we are" to "we're", "you will" to "you'll" and so on. Be careful how far you go; "it'll" is on the border for me and something like "our team'll" is clearly a shooting offence.

#### 2. Eliminate "that"

I often see unnecessary uses of "that" and "it", when you can remove them to keep the same meaning, but it sounds much more conversational. For example:

__It is best to post between 6-11pm, as this is when there is the largest amount of users active on Facebook. This means that your post is going to be seen by more people and get a higher reach.__

Take out the "that" and it still makes sense, but sounds more conversational:

__It is best to post between 6-11pm, as this is when there is the largest amount of users active on Facebook. This means your post is going to be seen by more people and get a higher reach.__

## When it's not appropriate to dumb down

Finally, a word of caution.

Sometimes it's not appropriate to simplify.

Be careful if you're writing a "How to..." guide that your flowing copy doesn't leave any room for confusion. Nobody will thank you if they flood their house because of a badly used apostrophe.

The same goes for technical pieces, for the same reason.

But don't forget - no matter who your writing's aimed at, everyone appreciates copy that's as readable as possible.

## Conclusion

Writing good copy makes the difference between winning or losing customers. We love helping our clients become winners.
