When it comes to choosing a content management platform for your website, there are a good number to choose from. And it’s an important decision; the choice dictates how well your website will work for you. Drupal, Joomla, Perch, MODX and our personal favourite, Wordpress are just a few of the possible systems you could employ to deliver a great website. But which one is right for you? We think Wordpress – here’s why:

## Ease of use

In years gone by, when you wanted to update content on your website, you’d have to contact your web development agency and book in the amendments. They would then update the copy and images nestled within the website code and send you the page to check over. Following that, the updates would be made live and you’d be charged for the time. It was all quite an ordeal and it could be rather expensive if you had a lot to update.

But that’s a thing of the past with a content management system (CMS) like WordPress. Updating your website couldn’t be easier; simply type straight into the editor or paste from Word and click update – there’s nothing more to it.

- Changed offices and need to update your address and phone number? No worries.
- Got an urgent notice to put on your website? Not a problem.
- Restructured your business and need to completely reorganise your website? Simple - WordPress has got it covered.

## Flexibility

As well as offering great ease of use, Wordpress is very scaleable. Many discount it as just a blogging platform but they couldn’t be more wrong. Although it started as blogging software in 2003, it’s been a fully functioning CMS since 2005 giving you the ability to manage pages, photos, products and much more. There really is very little that Wordpress cannot do.

Furthermore, it’s fully open-source and always expanding with a strong, growing community of developers and designers behind it. And if it doesn’t have a feature you need, being open-source you can just customise it to work perfectly for you.

## Marketability

We love Wordpress for [marketing](/creates/online-marketing/). It’s a brilliant platform to optimise for search engines and offers us unrivalled customisation to ensure that your website is found and appreciated by search engines and users alike.

The key to marketing a site well is to get quality optimisation in all areas of the website from the opening line of code to the final lines of copy you add to the website. Wordpress offers a great structure to work with whether we’ve built the website or we’ve taken on an existing website that needs to be marketed.

## Questions we get asked a lot


### Isn’t Wordpress just a free blogging website similar to tumblr?


- Not quite – [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) offers free blogs and works in a similar way to tumblr and blogger. It’s a great start if you want to try your hand at blogging but you’ll quickly find it has limits. [Wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org) is free and it supports blogging really well – but it’s so much more than that! With wordpress.org you have full access to the source code, get all the marketing benefits of the great system architecture and have the ability to fully change the appearance and functionality of the site to your needs

### Can’t I just set up a WordPress site myself?

- It’s not quite that simple. Although the initial installation of Wordpress only takes 5 minutes, developing the website takes a fair amount longer than that! We strive to make our websites as user friendly and flexible as possible and this take time to get perfect. For us, a default theme and a couple of plugins just won’t cut it.

### Don’t all Wordpress sites look the same?

- Certainly not! There’s a bit of a preconception that all WordPress sites look identical and there’s no room for flexibility. Sure – if you use a default theme or even a premium theme bought online, there’s a good chance that it will look similar to someone else’s websites. It’s estimated that over 15% of all websites in the world use Wordpress! We’re passionate about making websites that work hard for your business and fit your brand perfectly and the only way to ensure this is to design the site from the ground up. Need further proof?
