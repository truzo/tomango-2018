Digital innovations have been and still are transforming a whole host of different markets and how the companies in them do business.

Here are some examples - can you identify the companies? (Answers at the bottom):

- The largest taxi company owns no cars
- The largest media owner creates no content
- The largest provider of accommodation owns no properties


How have these companies achieved this?

*Digital disruption*.

![](images/blog/shutterstock_308664830-1024x725.jpg)For better or worse, the changing technological landscape for both businesses and customers alike is having large-scale evolutionary effects on many industries.

[James McQuivey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AotSKkw5FrE) notes that there are three root causes that have led to a huge amount of digital disruption in recent years:

1. The prevalence of *free or cheap digital tools* that allow people to set up a business and get to market quicker, and at a lower price point. This can include anything from setting up a website using WordPress to easily contacting overseas suppliers to reduce manufacturing costs.
1. The rise of *digital platforms* to enable businesses to reach customers in new ways. Think companies that utilise social media for customer services, wearable technology, or tailor-made apps.
1. Finally, the increase in the sheer *number of digital consumers* and with it their ability to readily accept finding new products and services online at a moment's notice.


Digital disruption is seeing new, innovative companies enter existing markets and offer products and services that are of better quality and can be delivered at a faster rate.

And it's great from a customer's perspective.

Previously, it was in a company's interest to build walls around its users to keep them in - perhaps, for example, making it overly costly to switch to a competitor brand.

Now, these walls have been replaced by windows, as companies actively seek to interact and collaborate with existing and potential customers.

Information can be shared both ways as a means of continuous improvement in business performance. And, if you're not happy with the service that's being provided to you, there are a multitude of other options for you to switch to - so it's really in the company's best interest to treat you well!

This means that businesses are having to really think about their *Online Value Proposition (OVP)* - what they can offer to customers in terms of products, services and experiences. In other words, what is it that a company does that would lead the customer to come back to them in the future? What's their online USP?

Digital disruption, and the new market entrants that come with it, can be detrimental to the performance of existing companies who do not or did not have the foresight to take it seriously.

Rather than react to change or be disrupted by it, some forward-looking businesses are investing in digital transformation to adapt and outperform competitors.

Here's two examples of companies that dealt with digital disruption in vastly different ways:

## Domino's

Pizza somehow always seems to be a great way of explaining [some facet of digital marketing](/thinks/local-seo-a-brief-guide/), and in this case, Domino's is a prime example of a company noticing its shortcomings, embracing a digital disruptive mindset, and seeing massive growth as a result.

Going back to November 2008, the share price of Domino's was a mere *$3.03*.

But they had a look at their end-to-end user experience, and were able to use digital methods to make it so good that their share price is (at time of writing) *$147* - an increase of *4,800 per cent!*

What did they do? They basically decided to become a [technology company that sells pizza](http://nrn.com/technology/how-domino-s-became-tech-company).

Keeping the user experience firmly in mind, they aimed to have over 50 per cent of their orders made through digital platforms by 2015 - a target they've exceeded by far.

Here's the key things they implemented:

- Pizza builder - enabling customers to easily create their ideal pizza online by selecting from a range of bases, toppings and crusts
- Pizza profile - once a customer has built their perfect pizza, they can then save this on their own online account to ensure trouble-free repeat business
- Pizza tracker - once the pizza is ordered, a customer can see exactly what stage their food is at, both online and from an app - from prep, to baking, to being out for delivery (it even has the names of the staff making and delivering it).


Dominos' easy order system has now expanded to take in even more digital channels - people can order pizzas through mobile devices, smart watches...you can even order by tweeting them a [pizza emoji](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11601989/Now-you-can-order-Dominos-by-tweeting-a-pizza-emoji.html)! &#x1f355; &#x1f355; &#x1f355;

## Kodak

Using actual film in an actual camera...seems a lifetime ago doesn't it! Nowadays, of course, practically everyone has a powerful, film-less camera in their pockets courtesy of their smartphones.

Kodak are one of the prime examples of a company not taking proper notice of the fluctuations in their market, and paying a hefty price for it.

What makes this all even more notable is that Kodak staff actually *invented the digital camera* as long ago as 1975.

When the question was asked of Kodak in the 1980s if there should be a concern about digital photography, their answer was that, yes - there's the capability for it to replace conventional film, but that Kodak had roughly a decade to prepare for the transition.

Except...they never took the initiative at all.

![](images/blog/shutterstock_92281837-1024x1024.jpg)

Kodak's market share and financial performance started to decline in the 1990s as digital photography grew in prominence.

At one point having a market share in the USA of over 90 per cent, failure to take the digital shift as seriously as they might've saw this decline to around 7 per cent in 2010.

In 2013 they pivoted their entire business to move away from photography, and Kodak now operates as a company predominantly focused on printing.

So how can your organisation get to grips with the opportunities - or threats - that digital disruption may hold?

1. For starters, *digital is everybody's job*. There's really no room for Luddites in a modern company, and ideally you'll want everyone to be comfortable with using digital tools.
1. *Automate where possible*. Whether it's Domino's using a pizza tracker, Amazon emailing you with delivery details, or online banking verification phone calls, automation can provide a consistent service and potentially reduce operating costs.
1. *Put yourself in the customer's shoes*. A company should think of itself as not selling a product or service, but providing a *solution*. If you can find the solution to a problem the customer doesn't yet know about, you're only going to improve your OVP.
1. And regarding OVP, think *intangible benefits*. Can you be throwing in something extra for your customers from the digital side of operations?
1. And finally, think SMACIT. That's *Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud, Internet of Things*. Considering new platforms and utilising data (think CRM systems) can help you create a business ecosystem that can help you improve operations and get closer to the customer with minimal cost and maximum reach.
